
Changes in version 1.17.1:

  o bug (caused by new R version 4.0.0) solved in morris_oat.R
  (matrix objects now also inherit from class "array")
  
  o exception "multiIndex[inputIndex] == 0 & der" solved in 
  PoincareChaosSqCoef.R
  
  o example with give data in sensiHSIc()
  
Changes in version 1.17.0:

    o New functions: squaredIntEstim.R and PoincareChaosSqCoef.R
    (which allows to compute the squared coefficients in 
    generalized chaos via Poincare differential operators)
    
    o Modification in PoincareOptimal.Rd concerning the 
    returned eigenvalues

Changes in version 1.16.3:

    o Unresolved matrix/array classes related bug on R4.0.0 version
    in morris.R, morris_oat.R, soboljansen.R, sobolmartinez.R
    and sobolroalhs.R
    Examples that do not work have been put in \donttest{} (these
    examples work in practice)
    
    o Resolved bug in plot.soboljansen() and plot.sobolmartinez
    when dealing with matrice-type model outputs
    
    o ylabel changed (from S to PLI) when plotting PLI examples
    
    o legends precised (between full and independent Sobol' indices) 
    when plotting Shapley effects

Changes in version 1.16.2:

    o   New functionalities in sensiHSIC() function
    (statistical tests of independence)
    
    o Graph legends corrected in sensiHSIC(), sensiFdiv(), sb() and
  sobolMultOut() functions
  
    o   Corrected bug in nodeggplot()
    
Changes in version 1.16.1:

    o   New function nodeggplot() (in order to ebautify the plots) 
    
    o   ggplot functions for the following functions:
    pcc, src, sensiFdiv, sensiHSIC, shapleyPermEx, shapleyPermrand,
    sobol, sobol2002, sobol2007, sobolEff, soboljansen, sobolmara, 
    sobolmartinez, sobolMultOut, sobolowen, sobolroalhs, sobolroauc,
    sobolsalt, sobolTIIlo, sobolTIIpf, soboltouati
    o   Functions sobolroalhs() and sobolSalt(): Modifications of 
    plot functions in order to have "XiXj" instead of "Xij""

    o   New output of function delsa(): Brute values of derivatives

    o   Test case corrected in pcc.Rd

Changes in version 1.16.0:

    o   Added functions for calculating Shapley indices from data: 
    shapleySubsetMC()
    
    o   Added functions for calculating PLI: PLIsuperquantile() and
    PLIquantile_multivar()
    
    o In the 3 PLI functions related to quantiles:
      - new arguments in order to have the PLI in percentage
      - the result also contains the perturbed quantiles values
      - bootstrap confidence intervals can be obtained
    
    o   Added the toy function heterdisc.fun()
    
Changes in version 1.15.2:

    o   Added functions for Morris method for multidimensional outputs:
    morrisMultOut()
    
    o   Added the toy function linkletter.fun()
    
    o   Change the names of the fcts (dtnorm, ..., dtgumbel, ...) by 
    (dnorm.trunc, ...) (reverse dependency pb with ATmet package).
    Export now the fcts, documentation entries in truncateddistrib.Rd
    
    o   Corrected bug: Replace \dontrun by \donttest in all Rd-files
    
    o   Corrected bug: package triangle is suggested and called in 
    PoincareOptimal.Rd
    
    o Function in sobolGPmethods.R and sobolpickfreeze.R have been 
    integrated in sobolGP.R
    
    o   Detected bug (not corrected) in tell.sobolGP() 
    Unused argument in km(), passed by eval(), update(), tell.sobolGP() ??)

    => comment in the example of sobolGP.Rd
    
Changes in version 1.15.1:

    o   Functions shapleyPermEx() corrected (confidence intervals)

Changes in version 1.15.0:

    o   Function "sobolCert.R" has been (temporarily) suppressed
    (compilation bug unresolved)
    
    o   Function "support.R" has been changed by O. Roustant (new plotting
    functionalities are available, as the function "scatterplot")
    
    o   Resolved bug about "sobolmartinez" method (now suppressed) in 
    the sobolMultOut() function

    o   sobolMultOut() now returns the functional Sobol' indices via
    the attributes "Sfct" and "Tfct" of the output object

Changes in version 1.14.0:

    o   Added functions for calculating Shapley indices: shapleyPermEx()
    and shapleyPermRand()

    o   Added function for calculating first order Sobol' indices via
    smoothing technique: sobolSmthSpl()
