
Changes in version 1.15.2:

    o   Added functions for Morris method for multidimensional outputs:
    morrisMultOut()
    
    o   Added the toy functions linkletter.fun()
    
    o   Change the names of the fcts (dtnorm, ..., dtgumbel, ...) by 
    (dnorm.trunc, ...) (reverse dependency pb with ATmet package).
    Export now the fcts, documentation entries in truncateddistrib.Rd
    
    o   Corrected bug: Replace \dontrun by \donttest in all Rd-files
    
    o   Corrected bug: package triangle is suggested and called in 
    PoincareOptimal.Rd
    
    o Function in sobolGPmethods.R and sobolpickfreeze.R have been 
    integrated in sobolGP.R
    
    o   Detected bug (not corrected) in tell.sobolGP() 
    Unused argument in km(), passed by eval(), update(), tell.sobolGP() ??)

    => comment in the example of sobolGP.Rd
    
Changes in version 1.15.1:

    o   Functions shapleyPermEx() corrected (confidence intervals)

Changes in version 1.15.0:

    o   Function "sobolCert.R" has been (temporarily) suppressed
    (compilation bug unresolved)
    
    o   Function "support.R" has been changed by O. Roustant (new plotting
    functionalities are available, as the function "scatterplot")
    
    o   Resolved bug about "sobolmartinez" method (now suppressed) in 
    the sobolMultOut() function

    o   sobolMultOut() now returns the functional Sobol' indices via
    the attributes "Sfct" and "Tfct" of the output object

Changes in version 1.14.0:

    o   Added functions for calculating Shapley indices: shapleyPermEx()
    and shapleyPermRand()

    o   Added function for calculating first order Sobol' indices via
    smoothing technique: sobolSmthSpl()
